                <p><span class="drive-b">B:/</span> Yeah, I'm here. What's up?</p>
                <p><span class="drive-c">C:/</span> Just logged in. Anything interesting going on?</p>
                <p><span class="drive-d">D:/</span> Not really. Just browsing some old message threads.</p>
                <p><span class="drive-a">A:/</span> Boring! Let's start a new thread. How about "What's the weirdest
                    thing
                    you've ever eaten?"</p>
                <p><span class="drive-b">B:/</span> I'll go first. I once had fried grasshoppers in Mexico.</p>
                <p><span class="drive-c">C:/</span> Gross! I've never tried anything too weird. Just your usual exotic
                    fruits like durian and jackfruit.</p>
                <p><span class="drive-d">D:/</span> I had kangaroo meat once. It was actually pretty tasty.</p>
                <p><span class="drive-a">A:/</span> I've had octopus balls in Japan. They were surprisingly delicious.
                </p>
                <p><span class="drive-b">B:/</span> Alright, enough about food. How about we discuss the latest tech
                    gadgets?</p>
                <p><span class="drive-c">C:/</span> I just got a new smartphone. It's got a huge screen and amazing
                    camera.</p>
                <p><span class="drive-d">D:/</span> Nice! I'm still using a flip phone. I don't see the need for all
                    these
                    fancy gadgets.</p>
                <p><span class="drive-a">A:/</span> Come on, <span class="drive-d">@D:/</span>, join us in the 21st
                    century!

                <p><span class="drive-b">B:/</span> Speaking of tech, has anyone heard about this thing called the
                    internet? I heard it's going to be
                    huge.</p>
                <p><span class="drive-c">C:/</span> Yeah, I've heard of it. But I don't think it'll catch on.</p>
                <p><span class="drive-d">D:/</span> Me neither. Why would anyone want to send electronic mail when you
                    can
                    just write a letter?</p>
                <p><span class="drive-a">A:/</span> You guys are so old-fashioned. I'm already on some BBS forums that
                    are
                    connected to the internet.</p>
                <p><span class="drive-b">B:/</span> Whoa, <span class="drive-a">@A:/</span>, you're ahead of the game.
                    Teach
                    us your ways!</p>
                <p><span class="drive-c">C:/</span> Yeah, show us how to use this internet thing.</p>
                <p><span class="drive-d">D:/</span> I think I'll stick to my trusty typewriter, thank you very much.</p>
