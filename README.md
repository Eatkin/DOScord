# DOScord

DOScord is a static website styled after Discord. Its design is reminiscent of command line interfaces. It uses Win16 colour palette and CSS grid for its layout.

## Introduction

DOScord is a practice project for me to learn some front-end development and Javascript.

It uses the Discord Server/Channel setup to give you multiple servers and channels to explore, each with their own chat and user base.

DOScord sources its data from [data.json](link-to-blob).

## Usage

DOScord is created with desktop usage in mind. It uses CSS grid so the layout is responsive, but also basically unusable on smaller screens.

To view DOScord, simple visit the [GitHub Pages website](link-here) where the project is hosted.

To run this locally, I recommend using the [Live Server Extension](link-to-extension) with VS Code.
